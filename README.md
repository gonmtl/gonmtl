# Hello There! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/nDIqWcH.png">

Iâ€™m Gonzalo, a **designer** who sometimes code! I live in Villa MarÃ­a, CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, iâ€™ve worked as freelancer and on-site on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups and charities. 
Iâ€™ve been designing for several years and now getting into the front-end world to do **app prototypes**, and also that helps me to understand better the workflow of the programmers leading to more "real and easy to implement" designs.
